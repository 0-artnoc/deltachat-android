# Thank you for contributing to Delta Chat.

Delta Chat is divided in two parts: Android and [Core](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core).

In short, the Android part is about the User Interface. The Interface is translated using [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/delta-chat/delta-chat-android). The Core part is about handling the connection to the mail server and the chat or e-mail messages as well as providing secure communication by using [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org/en/latest/).

Delta Chat Core is used in the Android and in the [iOS](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-ios) version.

Please try to create your issue to the respective Issue tracker: Here, or in [Core](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core/issues). Don't worry, if you are not sure. We will move the issue if necessary.

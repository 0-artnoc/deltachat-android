Build
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beside a build in Android Studio, you have to call `ndk-build` in the
`MessengerProj` directory.  Moreover, place a copy of your keyfile eg. to
`MessengerProj/config/debug.keystore`.

The core library (https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core), is checked out
automatically; there is no need to build the core library itself, the android
client just references the needed files.

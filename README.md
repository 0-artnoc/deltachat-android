Build
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the core library (https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core) is not checked
out together with this deltachat-android, you must check out it manually using
`git submodule update --init --recursive` for this purpose.  There is no need to 
build the core library itself, deltachat-android just references them.

After that, call `ndk-build` in the `MessengerProj` directory to build the C-part
and run the project in Android Atudio.

With chance, that's it :)

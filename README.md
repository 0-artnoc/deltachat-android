================================================================================

Build
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After checking out the deltachat-android repository, it may be needed to checkout the submodule deltachat-core explicitly;
type `git submodule update --init --recursive` for this purpose.

Beside a build in Android Studio, you have to call `ndk-build` in the
`MessengerProj` directory.

The core library (https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core), is checked out
automatically; there is no need to build the core library itself, the android
client just references the needed files.

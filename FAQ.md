Frequently Asked Questions
================================================================================

**To whom can I write?**

- With MailApp, you can write to users using MailApp - or any other existing
  e-mail-client.  This is one of the biggest differences to other messengers:
  there is no need for the receiver to install the same app as yours.
  
**But E-Mail ... is so slow**

- This is not true for most accounts. In fact, there are standards as Push-IMAP
  for years, that allow receiving Mails in a second or so.  
  Unfortunately, many clients does not support these standards - but MailApp 
  will.

**What, if the receiver does not use MailApp?**

- the receiver will get a normal mail then - if he replies to it, of course,
  you will see the reply in your MailApp
